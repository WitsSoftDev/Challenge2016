There are N number of applicants and you can only interview one at a time. You have a system where you score each applicant after interviewing them. No two tutors can have the same score. You want the tutor with the highest score. Make a program that accepts the number of applicants and then every applicant, after each ‘interview’ you rate the applicants. At the end of the program it must determine the top applicant. (As a challenge look up: http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/75967/solve-the-secretary-problem for the way to determine the highest applicant with the least amount of code)\r\n\r\n## Challenge 2\r\nCreate a rock paper scissors game which plays better than a human. (Hint: humans can never think of good random numbers). A text/command-line interface is acceptable.\r\n\r\n## Challenge 3\r\nTic Tac Toe\r\nWrite a program that will play Tic Tac Toe. A text/command-line interface is acceptable. The computer must always start the game and the first move must always be the centre. The user will then input their desired move by inputting the row and column they wish to play. The next moves of the computer must then be randomly determined from the set of moves left. When either opponent wins a message must declare the winner and the program should terminate.\r\n2.2.1 Example\r\n0 1 2\r\nA |X| | |\r\nB | |O| |\r\nC | | | |\r\nComputer plays … B1\r\nPlayer’s Turn: A0\r\n",
